 - Title: Dilemma 1: Brad

# Description
When you started, you were told that Brad was one of your top performers, but that’s not what you have experienced so far.
You have no doubt that he is talented, but you feel that he is getting sloppy (resting on the laurels?)
and often find him being arrogant, especially towards the newer team members.

It’s now time for your appraisal dialogue with Brad. What approach shall you choose?

# Choice
You tell him exactly how you feel, and try to appeal to him to improve his behavior

# Variables
 - Time: -1
 - engagement: -3
 - performance: -2
 - Total score: round(((engagement * performance) / 100) - (100 - Time))

# Feedback
*Feedback:*

Most people react negatively to being directly confronted with personal weaknesses.
You must find a way to share objectives and goals with Brad - instead of just confronting him.

*Outcome:*

You experienced a drop in both engagement (-3) as well as  Performance (-2)
Time spent on response: -1

# Choice
You pick up 3 problematic situations from the past month where Brad’s behaviour have been a problem, and ask him to explain himself
 - time: -1

# Variables
 - engagement: -4
 - performance: -3
 - total: round(((engagement * performance) / 100) - (100 - time))

# Feedback
*Feedback:*

Most people react negatively to being directly confronted with personal weaknesses. Spelling it out with problematic examples makes it even worse.
You must find a way to share objectives and goals with Brad - instead of just confronting him.
This was the choice with the poorest outcome out of the 4 choices available.

*Outcome:*

You experienced a drop in both engagement (-4) as well as  Performance (-3)
Time spent on response: -1

# Choice
You assume that there is an underlying problem that you should identify first. Therefore you start asking positive questions about what Brad likes/dislikes about his job – and ask into his ambitions for the future

# Variables
 - time: -1
 - engagement: +2
 - performance: +2
 - total: round(((engagement * performance) / 100) - (100 - time))

# Feedback
*Feedback:*

Great choice – the best of all choices available!
By asking question you build a relation instead of just criticizing.

*Outcome:*

You experienced an improvement in both engagement (+2) as well as  Performance (+2)
Time spent on response: -1

# Choice
You let him know that you are aware that there is a serious problem – but tell him that you are ready to help and coach him in weekly conversations for at least the coming 4 weeks

# Variables
 - time: -5
 - engagement: +0
 - performance: +0
 - total: round(((engagement * performance) / 100) - (100 - time))

# Feedback
*Feedback:*

This is a way of postponing the problem, and holds no guarantee for effect.
If you considered this route, you would need to have a conversation with Brad first – starting by asking some good questions.

*Outcome:*

You experienced no change in neither engagement or performance (as results could go either way)
Time spent on response: -5
