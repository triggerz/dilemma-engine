# Description
There is a flu going round, and you just received a message that Joan will not be coming in tomorrow morning. 

If you cannot find a replacement, the monthly production targets are in risk of not being met, as the lack of the extra set of hands is likely to slow down the production. 

But: You have already asked around, and no-one wants to take the shift. 

There is no way around it: You have to go back and ask one who have already turned you down the first time you asked. 

Who will you contact next?

# Choice
Lilly? When you her asked the first time, she answered that she had already taken on two extra shifts in the past 3 weeks, so she did not want to take another one! (but you have a sense that you could talk her into itâ€¦)

# Variables
 - strategic: -1
 - accountability: -1
 - ambiguity: +2
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
You probably picked Lilly because you sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. The problem is that you often end up asking the same few people. And that make your most flexible people feel misused.   

But, in all fairness, you did not have many good choices. It would have been just as good if you had asked Jonas - maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist? 

Asking Lilly or Jonas lead to the same score. 

But it was good that you did not pick Achmed, as we must respect that the Friday prayers are important to Muslims. 

Also good that you did not pick to give up. That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available. 

So - all in all: A good choice - though such situations are never fun. But next time, ask Jonas - so it's not always Lilly that solves the problem. 

# Outcome

You experienced a positive effect in output (+2) but it costed some in Lilly's engagement (-1) as you spent some time convincing Lilly to accept (-1 on strategic) 


# Choice
Jonas? When you him asked the first time, he really wanted to help, but couldn't because he had promised to drive his son to the dentist tomorrowself

# Variables
 - strategic: -1
 - accountability: -1
 - ambiguity: +2
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
Many would have asked Lilly first, because they sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. As you know, the problem is that you often end up asking the same few people. And that make your most flexible people feel misused.    

So you decided to try with Jonas, which was a good call (maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist?)

# Choice
No-one? Though it's likely to cost a slightly lower output tomorrow, this is what happens from time to time.

# Variables
 - strategic: +0
 - accountability: +0
 - ambiguity: -4
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
You gave up too early! That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available.

# Outcome

You experienced a negative effect in output (-4). No effect on neither engagement nor resource spend. 



# Choice
Achmed? When you him asked the first time, he pointed out that its Friday tomorrow, and that he had planned to visit his mosque. 

# Variables
 - strategic: -1
 - accountability: -2
 - ambiguity: +2
 - total: round(((accountability * ambiguity) / 100) - (100 - strategic))

# Feedback
Picking Achmed was a poor choice as we must respect that the Friday prayers are important to Muslims. So it demonstrated a poor understanding of his cultural values. 
In this case, he would have said yes to your request - but it would have made him feel bad, so it there was a large price on his engagement to be paid. 

Many would have asked Lilly first, because they sensed that she would save yes, and that would solve your problem. As you know, the problem with this are that you often end up asking the same few people which can make your most flexible people feel misused.   

You could also safely have asked Jonas (maybe someone else could have taken the trip to the dentist?) 

Asking Lilly or Jonas lead to the same score. 

But great that you did not give up. That option must be reserved to cases where there are really no more options available. 



# Outcome
