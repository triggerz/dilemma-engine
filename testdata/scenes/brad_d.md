 - Title: Feedback on choice D (Brad)

# Description
*Your response:*

You let him know that you are aware that there is a serious problem – but tell him that you are ready to help and coach him in weekly conversations for at least the coming 4 weeks

*Feedback:*

This is a way of postponing the problem, and holds no guarantee for effect.
If you considered this route, you would need to have a conversation with Brad first – starting by asking some good questions.

*Outcome:*

You experienced no change in neither engagement or performance (as results could go either way)
Time spent on response: -5
